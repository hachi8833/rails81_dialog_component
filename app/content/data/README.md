# Data

Perron can consume structured data from YML, JSON or CSV files, making them available within views. This is useful for populating features, team members or any other repeated data structure.


## Usage

Access data sources using the `Content::Data` namespace with the class name matching the file's basename:
```erb
<% Content::Data::Features.all.each do |feature| %>
  <h4><%= feature.name %></h4>
  <p><%= feature.description %></p>
<% end %>
```

Look up a single entry with `Content::Data::Features.find("advanced-search")`, where `"advanced-search"` matches the value of the entry's `id` field.


## File location and formats

By default, Perron looks up `app/content/data/` for files with a `.yml`, `.json` or `.csv` extension. For a `features` call, it would find `features.yml`, `features.json` or `features.csv`. Provide a path to any data resource in `/app/content/data/`, via `Content::Data.new("path/to/data-resource")`.


## Accessing data

The wrapper object provides flexible, read-only access to each record's attributes. Both dot notation and hash-like key access are supported.
```ruby
feature.name
feature[:name]
```


## Rendering

Render data collections directly using Rails-like partial rendering:
```erb
<%= render Content::Data::Features.all %>
```

This expects a partial at `app/views/content/features/_feature.html.erb` that will be rendered once for each item in `Content::Data::Features.all`. The individual record is made available as a local variable matching the singular form of the collection name.
```erb
<!-- app/views/content/features/_feature.html.erb -->
<div class="feature">
  <h4><%= feature.name %></h4>
  <p><%= feature.description %></p>
</div>
```


## Data structure

Data resources must contain an array of objects. Each record should include an `id` field if used with [associations](/docs/resources/#associations) or with the `find` method:
```yaml
# app/content/data/authors.yml
- id: rails-designer
  name: Rails Designer
  bio: Creator of Perron

- id: cam
  name: Cam
  bio: Contributing author
```


## Enumerable methods

[!label v0.17.0+]

All data objects support enumerable methods like `select`, `sort_by`, `first` and `count`. See [Enumerable methods](/docs/rendering/#enumerable-methods) for the full list of available methods.
